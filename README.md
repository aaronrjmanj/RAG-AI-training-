RAG implementation using LLAMA2 LLM
•	Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the Llama2 language model. 
•	This project involved setting up the environment, initializing models and embeddings, and loading documents for retrieval. 
•	This project provided hands-on experience with AI and GenAI fundamentals, including model optimization and deployment 
Next Steps:
Planning to improve the inference performance and understanding how to improve bandwidth by adding GPU.
